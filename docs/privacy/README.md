When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if such actions are not reasonably practicable (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.

However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk.

### IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, THE FOLLOWINGS MAY APPLY TO YOU

If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.

If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with Services, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Services. To request removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Services, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from all our systems (e.g., backups, etc.).

The California Code of Regulations defines a “resident” as:

- every individual who is in the State of California for other than a temporary or transitory purpose

We may use your personal information for our own business purposes, such as for undertaking internal research for technological development and demonstration. This is not considered to be “selling” of your personal information.

We have not disclosed, sold, or shared any personal information to third parties for a business or commercial purpose in the preceding twelve (12) months. We will not sell or share personal information in the future belonging to website visitors, users, and other consumers.

### Your Rights with Respect to Your Personal Data

1. Right to request deletion of the data.

You can ask for the deletion of your personal information. If you ask us to delete your personal information, we will respect your request and delete your personal information, subject to certain exceptions provided by law, such as (but not limited to) the exercise by another consumer of his or her right to free speech, our compliance requirements resulting from a legal obligation, or any processing that may be required to protect against illegal activities.

1. Right to be informed.

Depending on the circumstances, you have a right to know:

- whether we collect and use your personal information;
- the categories of personal information we collect;
- the purposes for which the collected personal information;
- whether we sell or share personal information to third parties;
- the categories of personal information that we sold, shared, or disclosed for a business purpose;

In accordance with applicable law, we are not obligated to provide or delete consumer information that is de-identified in response to a consumer request or to re-identify individual data to verify a consumer request.

1. Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights.

We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.

1. Right to Limit Use and Disclosure of Sensitive Personal Information.

We do not process consumer’s sensitive personal information.

1. Verification Process.

Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.

We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.

- You may object to the processing of your personal information.
- You may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant or ask to restrict the processing of the information.

- You may request to opt out from future selling or sharing of your personal information to third parties. Upon receiving an opt-out request, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than fifteen (15) days from the date of the request submission.

1. **IF YOU ARE LOCATED IN THE EEA, SWITZERLAND, OR THE UNITED KINGDOM, THE FOLLOWINGS APPLY TO YOU.**

As of May 25, 2018, a new data privacy law known as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (the “**GDPR**”) becomes effective through the European Economic Area (“**EEA**”), Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. The GDPR requires us and those using the Services to provide users with certain information about the processing of their “**Personal Data**.” “Personal Data” is a term used under the GDPR that means, generally, data that identifies or can identify a particular unique user or device – for instance, names, addresses, cookie identifiers, mobile IDs, precise location data, and biometric data.

To comply with the GDPR, we provide the below representations and information, which are specific to persons located in the EEA, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom.

**_Legal Grounds for Processing Personal Data_**

The GDPR requires us to tell you about the legal ground we are relying on to process any Personal Data about you. The legal grounds for us to process your Personal Data for the purposes set out above will typically be because:

1. You Provided Your Consent: To store and/or gain access to information, we rely on your consent.

1. The Processing is in Our Legitimate Interest: In some cases, we rely on legitimate interest as a legal basis for processing Personal Data to provide our and/or other data controllers’ services. For instance, legitimate interests may include the tailoring of promotional communications, improving our Website and Services, and maintaining the security of the Services, etc.

1. Contractual Relationships: Sometimes we process certain data as necessary under a contractual relationship we have.

1. Legal Obligations: Some processing of data may be necessary for us to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations.

**_Transfer of Personal Data_**

To the extent we work with global companies and technologies, we may need to transfer your Personal Data outside of the country from which it was originally provided. For instance, we may transfer your data to third parties that we work with who may be located in jurisdictions outside of the EEA, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom, and which have no data protection laws or laws that are less strict in comparison to those in Europe.

To transfer your Personal Data outside of the EEA, Switzerland or the United Kingdom, we rely on the European Commission’s adequacy decisions on certain countries and, for other jurisdictions, we rely on the Standard Contractual Clauses as approved by the European Commission and any applicable country addenda. Please contact us at the contact information below for more information about the safeguards we have put in place to protect your Personal Data and privacy rights in these circumstances.

**_Personal Data Retention_**

As a general matter, we retain your Personal Data for as long as necessary to provide the Services, or for other important purposes such as complying with legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. If you are a client of ours and thus have an account with us, we will typically retain your Personal Data for the period of time in which you have an account with us.

**_Your Rights as a Data Subject_**

The GDPR provides you with certain rights in respect to Personal Data that data controllers (as explained further below) hold about you, including certain rights to access Personal Data, to request correction of the Personal Data, to request to restrict or delete Personal Data, and to object to our processing of your Personal Data (including profiling for online ad targeting).

1. Right to Access: If you wish to exercise your right to access Personal Data we process as a data controller, you may do so by requesting access via the contact information provided in “HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?”. Upon receiving your request, we will assess requests on a case-by-case basis, verify your identity and whether the data truly and solely belongs to you, and may limit the Personal Data we make available. Please note that we will only grant requests submitted for Personal Data for which we are a data controller. Where we act as a data processor for one of our clients, we will refer your request to that client. Please identify the client your request refers to (if possible) to simplify this process.

1. Right to Correct: If you wish to exercise your right to correct or update your Personal Data, you may do so by contacting us at the contact information below.

1. Right to Object to Processing or to Withdraw Consent: You may withdraw consent for processing your Personal Data.

1. Right to Erasure: You also have the right to request that we erase the Personal Data concerning you that we hold as a data controller. Please note, however, that we may retain copies of certain Personal Data on inactive or back-up files, for our own internal and necessary purposes, including but not limited to auditing, accounting and billing, legal, or bug detection. We will retain your Personal Data for the period necessary to fulfill any important purposes that we have in retaining it, principally regarding legal, auditing, accounting, and billing obligations.

1. Right to Lodge Complaints: You have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. However, we hope that you will first consult with us, so that we may work with you to resolve any complaint or concern you might have.

**_Questions or Concerns_**

If you are a resident of the EEA, Switzerland, or the United Kingdom and have concerns regarding this Section VIII, please contact us via the contact information provided in “HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?”.

**_Complaints_**

If you are located in the EEA or the United Kingdom and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your [Member State data protection authority](https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm) or [UK data protection authority](https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/data-protection-complaints/data-protection-complaints/).

If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the [Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner.](https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html)

1. **IF YOU ARE LOCATED IN CANADA, THE FOLLOWINGS APPLY TO YOU.**

We may process your information if you have given us specific permission (i.e., express consent) to use your personal information for a specific purpose, or in situations where your permission can be inferred (i.e., implied consent). You can withdraw your consent at any time.

In some exceptional cases, we may be legally permitted under applicable law to process your information without your consent, including, for example:

- If collection is clearly in the interests of an individual and consent cannot be obtained in a timely way;
- For investigations and fraud detection and prevention;
- For business transactions provided certain conditions are met;
- If it is contained in a witness statement and the collection is necessary to assess, process, or settle an insurance claim;
- For identifying injured, ill, or deceased persons and communicating with next of kin;
- If we have reasonable grounds to believe an individual has been, is, or may be victim of financial abuse;
- If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province;
- If disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules of the court relating to the production of records;
- If it was produced by an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was produced;
- If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or literary purposes; and
- If the information is publicly available and is specified by the regulations.

## CONTROLS FO DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES

Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy policy.

## DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated “Revised” date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy policy, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy policy frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.
