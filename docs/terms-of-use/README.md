**DEBANK GLOBAL PTE. LTD.** (“**Rabby**”, the “**Company**”, “**we**”, “**us**” or “**our**”) is a blockchain development company, focused on utilizing decentralized technologies. Our software is powering a revolution in commerce and finance and helping to optimize business processes. The Company hosts a top-level domain website, **[https://rabby.io/](https://rabby.io/)**, that provides information regarding the Company and its service offerings, products and services, as well as sub-domains for our products or services (the top-level domain with the sub-domains collectively referred to as the “**Site**”), which include text, images, audio, code and other materials or third-party information.

These Terms of Service, including their appendix (these “**Terms**” or this “**Agreement**”) (i) contain the terms and conditions that govern your access to and use of the Site and Offerings (as defined below) and (ii) constitute a legally binding agreement between us and you and/or the entity you represent (“**you**”, “**your**” or “**user**”).

ARBITRATION NOTICE: THIS AGREEMENT IS SUBJECT TO BINDING ARBITRATION AS DETAILED IN SECTION 1. PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY.

## **The Offerings.**

1. Generally. You may access and use the Offerings only in accordance with this Agreement. You agree to comply with the terms of this Agreement and all laws, rules and regulations applicable to your use of the Offerings.

1. Offerings and Access. The Company offers a number of Offerings under the Rabby brand or brands owned by us. These include Rabby Wallet, which enables users to (i) store locally on their own devices, tokens, cryptocurrencies and other crypto or any digital asset (including virtual currency or virtual commodity) which is a digital representation of value based on (or built on top of) a cryptographic protocol of a computer network (collectively, “**Digital Assets**”); (ii) link to decentralized applications, including, without limitation, decentralized exchanges (collectively “**Dapp(s)**”); (iii) from the user interface, swap assets on a peer-to-peer basis via third-party Dapps; (iv) view addresses and information that are part of digital asset networks and broadcast transactions; and (v) view and use additional Offerings as may be added to the Site or the app from time to time (collectively the “**Offerings**” or “**Services**”). Offerings are generally accessed through the Site or through a third-party provider of which we approved, such as the Apple App stores, unless otherwise agreed in writing. Some Offerings may require you to create an account with the Company, enter a valid form of payment, and select a paid plan (a “**Paid Plan**”), or initiate an Order. For the purpose of this Agreement, “**Order**” means an order for Offerings executed through an order form directly with the Company, or through a cloud vendor, such as Amazon Web Services.

1. Third Party Content and Services.In certain Offerings, including swaps and bridging, you may view, have access to, and may use the informational content, products, or services of one or more third parties (“**Third Party Content**” and “**Third Party Services**” respectively). In each such case, you agree that you view, access or use such content and services at your own election. Your reliance on any Third Party Content and use of Third Party Services in connection with the Offerings is governed on one hand by this Agreement but, on the other hand, will also generally be subject to separate terms and conditions set forth by the applicable third party content and/or service provider. Those terms and conditions may involve separate fees and charges or may include disclaimers or risk warnings about reliance on or the accuracy of any information. Such terms may also apply a privacy policy different than that which the Company maintains and incorporates into this Agreement. It is your responsibility to understand the terms and conditions of Third Party Services, including how those service providers use any of your information under their privacy policies.

   Third Party Content and Third Party Services are provided for your convenience only. We do not verify, curate, or control Third Party Content. We do not control Third Party Services. As a result, we do not guarantee, endorse, or recommend such content or services to any or all users of the Offerings, or the use of such content or services for any particular purpose. You access, rely upon or use any Third Party Content or Third Party Service at your own risk. The Company disclaims all responsibility and liability for any Losses on account of your reliance upon or use of such content or services. We have no responsibility for Third Party Content that may be misleading, incomplete, erroneous, offensive, indecent, or otherwise objectionable to you or under the law in your jurisdiction. The choice to rely on Third Party Content or to use a Third Party Service is your own, and you are solely responsible for ensuring that your reliance or use is in compliance with all applicable laws. Dealing or correspondence with any third party that provides such content or services is solely between you and that third party. We reserve the right to change, suspend, remove, disable, or impose access restrictions or limits on the use of any Third Party Service at any time without notice.

1. Bridge. The bridge is one of the means of accessing the protocol, and it may not be the exclusive means of accessing the protocol, as there may be alternative bridges relying on different smart contracts and interfaces deployed by third parties which support bridging token and other assets. You may also access a bridge directly using these other third-party interfaces or even through command line instructions.

    You accept all risks associated with using the bridge. Bridging is an extremely novel technical area and is subject to material risks which may lead to total loss of user assets. All bridges are smart contracts that are subject to many known and unknown risks, including smart contract exploits of the actual smart contract code to produce outcomes different than those the bridge was designed to achieve, and cyberattacks intended to gain unauthorized control of the smart contracts or associated systems.

    The bridges may impose a volume limitation of tokens flowing into and out of the protocol. All users of the bridge may be subject to the limitation, which may impact the time it takes you to bridge in or out of the protocol while using the bridge. That volume limitation may or may not be disclosed on **[https://rabby.io/](https://rabby.io/)**. The volume limitation is a security measure to limit harm in the event of a malicious third-party act, and it may be changed without notice. Additionally, you acknowledge the risk that the volume limitation may not be technically effective, or may even be compromised. You accept the risk that it will not function as intended and assume any Losses, direct, indirect, or consequential, stemming from the volume limitations.

1. In connection with Third Party Services such as swaps, you understand and agree that swap rates and prices are estimates only, and that they may change at any time. Accordingly, the prices or swap rates provided via Rabby are estimates only and may be inaccurate. The Company may not be held liable for, and you hereby forever release the Company from, any Losses or other liabilities arising from an inaccurate estimate of fees provided in connection with any use of any of the Offerings.

1. Support. You may seek or receive technical or product support, information, advice, or guidance from us regarding the Offerings, including via third-party service provider, chat interface, or email. All support made available or provided by or on behalf of the Company is believed to be reliable, but we do not make representations or warranties, express or implied, as to its accuracy, its completeness, or the results to be obtained. Such support is being provided for informational purposes only and, by accepting such support, you represent that you have adequate skill and experience regarding the proper selection, use, and/or application of Offerings and use such Offerings at your own discretion and risk. You shall hold us harmless for any injury that may result from the support you receive from us. **You are aware that our customer support efforts may be impersonated by malicious third parties, and you agree that we are not responsible for the actions of such impersonators. You further acknowledge that we will not offer support via SMS, WhatsApp, Telegram or WeChat, and that we will never ask you for your private key or secret recovery phrase (the “Recovery Phrase”) or for you to make a payment to us.**

1. Changes to the Offerings. We may change or discontinue any or all of the Offerings or change or remove Offerings of any or all of the Offerings from time to time. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to communicate to you any discontinuation of an Offering through the Site or public communication channels. If you are on a Paid Plan, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to communicate to you any discontinuation of the Offering at least 30 days in advance of such discontinuation, and we will use commercially reasonable efforts to continue supporting the Offering for up to three months after the discontinuation, except if doing so (a) would pose an information security or intellectual property issue, (b) is economically or technically burdensome, or (c) would create undue risk of us violating the law.

   We cannot guarantee the Offerings will be available at all times. We may experience hardware, software, or other problems or need to perform maintenance related to the Offerings, resulting in interruptions, delays, or errors. We reserve the right to change, revise, update, suspend, discontinue, or otherwise modify the Offerings at any time or for any reason without notice to you. You agree that we have no liability whatsoever for any loss, damage, or inconvenience caused by your inability to access or use the Services during any downtime or discontinuance of the Services. Nothing in these Terms will be construed to obligate us to maintain and support the Services or to supply any corrections, updates, or releases in connection therewith. We will not be liable if for any reason all or any part of our Offerings become unavailable at any time or for any period. From time to time, we may restrict user access, including registered user access, to some parts of the Offerings or the entire Offerings.

These terms apply to all Offerings regardless of whether they require a Paid Plan.

1. Offering Fees. If your use of an Offering does not require an Order or Paid Plan but software licensing fees are charged contemporaneously with your use of the Offering, those fees will be charged as described on the Site or in the user interface of the Offering. Such fees may be calculated by combining a fee charged by us and a fee charged by a third party that provides certain functionality related to the Offering. You may incur charges from third parties for use of Third Party Content or Third Party Services. For example, you may be charged fees via the Dapps (including, without limitation, decentralized exchanges) that you may access via Rabby. Under no circumstances shall the Company incur any liability, of any kind, to you arising from or relating to fees charged to you by such Third Parties or for Third Party Services linked to or accessed through the Site or the Offerings. For those Offerings which entail an Order or Paid Plan, we calculate and bill fees and charges according to your Order or Paid Plan. For such Offerings, on the first day of each billing period, you will pay us the applicable fees (the “**Base Fees**”) and any applicable taxes based on the Offerings in the Paid Plan. In addition, for particular Orders, we may issue an invoice to you for all charges above the applicable threshold for your Paid Plan which constitute overage fees for the previous billing period. If you make any other changes to the Offerings during a billing period (for example, upgrading or downgrading your Paid Plan), we will apply any additional charges or credits to the next billing period. We may bill you more frequently for fees accrued at our discretion upon notice to you. You will pay all fees in U.S. dollars unless the particular Offering specifies a different form of payment or otherwise agreed to by you and us in writing. All amounts payable by you under this Agreement will be paid to us without setoff or counterclaim, and without any deduction or withholding. Fees and charges for any new Offering or new feature of an Offering will be effective when we use commercially reasonable efforts to communicate updated fees and charges through our Site, the interface of the Offering itself, or other public channels or, if you are on a Paid Plan, upon commercially reasonable efforts to notify you directly, but we may expressly state when notifying you that another effective date applies. We may increase or add new fees and charges for any existing Offerings you are using by using commercially reasonable efforts to notify users of the Offerings through our Site, the interface of the Offering itself, other public channels or, if you are on a Paid Plan, by giving you thirty (30) days’ notice. Unless otherwise specified in an Order, all Paid Plan amounts due under this Agreement are payable within thirty (30) days following receipt of your invoice. We may elect to charge you interest at the rate of one-point-fiver percent (1.5%) per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) on all late payments.
1. Taxes. Each party will be responsible, as required under applicable law, for identifying and paying all taxes and other governmental fees and charges (and any penalties, interest, and other additions thereto) that are imposed on that party upon or with respect to the transactions and payments under this Agreement. All fees payable by you are exclusive taxes unless otherwise noted. We reserve the right to withhold taxes where required.

We take no responsibility and assume no liability for any User Content, including any loss or damage to any of your User Content.

## **Term; Termination.**

1. These Terms shall remain in full force and effect while you use the Services or our Site. WITHOUT LIMITING ANY OTHER PROVISION OF THESE TERMS, WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION AND WITHOUT NOTICE OR LIABILITY, DENY ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE SERVICES (INCLUDING BLOCKING CERTAIN IP ADDRESSES), TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY REASON OR FOR NO REASON, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION FOR BREACH OF ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR COVENANT CONTAINED IN THESE TERMS OR OF ANY APPLICABLE LAW OR REGULATION. WE MAY TERMINATE YOUR USE OR PARTICIPATION IN THE SERVICES OR DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT AND ANY CONTENT OR INFORMATION THAT YOU POSTED AT ANY TIME, WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE, IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION.

If we terminate or suspend your account for any reason, you are prohibited from registering and creating a new account under your name, a fake or borrowed name, or the name of any third party, even if you may be acting on behalf of the third party. In addition to terminating or suspending your account, we reserve the right to take appropriate legal action, including without limitation pursuing civil, criminal, and injunctive redress.

1. Effect of Termination. Upon termination:
   1. all your rights under this Agreement are terminated immediately;
   1. each party remains responsible for all fees and charges it has incurred through the Term and is responsible for any fees and charges it incurs during the post-termination period; and
   1. the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement to the full extent necessary for their enforcement and for the protection of the party in whose favor they operate. For instance, should this Agreement between you and us is terminated, any dispute raised after you stop accessing or using the Offerings will be subject to the applicable provisions of this Agreement if that dispute relates to your prior access or use.

For any use of the Offerings under a Paid Plan after the termination, you will be responsible for paying the applicable fees at the rates set out in Section 5 of this Agreement.

Your acceptance of these Terms shall be treated as an acceptance of the DPA. We reserve the right to update the DPA from time to time to comply with legal and regulatory requirements, and to keep current with upgrades and enhancements to our Services.

## **Disclaimers; Acknowledgment of Certain Risks.**

1. DISCLAIMER. THE OFFERINGS ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW, OR TO THE EXTENT ANY STATUTORY RIGHTS APPLY THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, LIMITED OR WAIVED, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WE AND OUR AFFILIATES, LICENSORS, AND SERVICE PROVIDERS (I) MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE REGARDING THE OFFERINGS, THE THIRD PARTY CONTENT, OR THE THIRD PARTY SERVICES, AND (II) DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED OR EXPRESS WARRANTIES (A) OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR QUIET ENJOYMENT, (B) ARISING OUT OF ANY COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE, (C) THAT THE OFFERINGS, THIRD PARTY CONTENT, OR THIRD PARTY SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR FREE, ACCURATE, SECURE, OR FREE OF HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND (D) THAT ANY CONTENT WILL BE SECURE OR NOT OTHERWISE LOST OR ALTERED.

   YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT WE ASSUME NO LIABILITY OR RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY (I) ERRORS, MISTAKES, OR INACCURACIES OF CONTENT AND MATERIALS, (II) PERSONAL INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE, OF ANY NATURE WHATSOEVER, RESULTING FROM YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE OFFERINGS, (III) ANY UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR USE OF OUR SITES AND SERVICES AND/OR ANY AND ALL PERSONAL INFORMATION STORED THEREIN, (IV) ANY INTERRUPTION OR CESSATION OF TRANSMISSION TO OR FROM THE OFFERINGS, (V) ANY BUGS, VIRUSES, TROJAN HORSES, OR THE LIKE WHICH MAY BE TRANSMITTED TO OR THROUGH THE OFFERINGS BY ANY THIRD PARTY, (VI) ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ANY CONTENT AND MATERIALS, OR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY KIND INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF ANY CONTENT POSTED, TRANSMITTED, OR OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE VIA THE OFFERINGS, AND (VII) INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT OF ANY THIRD PARTY.

1. Acknowledgment of Certain Risks. By accessing and using the Offerings, you represent that you understand the inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and blockchain-based systems, and that you have a working knowledge of the usage and intricacies of Digital Assets. You further understand that the markets for these Digital Assets are highly volatile due to factors including (but not limited to) adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation. You acknowledge and accept that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems such as Rabby are variable and may increase dramatically at any time. You further acknowledge and accept the risk that your Digital Assets, or any Digital Assets you acquire, including through a third-party exchange accessed via swaps may lose some or all of their value and you may suffer loss due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens and/or significant price slippage and cost. You understand that anyone can create a token, including fake versions of existing tokens and tokens that falsely claim to represent projects, and acknowledge and accept the risk that you may mistakenly trade those or other tokens. You further acknowledge that we are not responsible for any of these variables or risks and that we cannot be held liable for any resulting Losses that you experience while accessing or using the Site or the Offerings.

The Site and Offerings and your Digital Assets could be impacted by one or more government or regulatory inquiries or government or regulatory actions, which could impede or limit the ability of the Company to continue to make its proprietary software, and thus, could impede or limit your ability to continue to use the Offerings.

You understand and acknowledge that cryptography is a progressing field with advances in code cracking and other technical advancements, such as the development of quantum computers, which may present risks to Digital Assets and our Services, and could result in the theft or loss of your Digital Assets. To the extent possible, we intend to update the Company-developed smart contracts related to the Offerings to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures necessary to address risks presented from technological advancements, but that intention does not reflect a binding commitment and does not in any way guarantee or otherwise ensure full security of the Offerings.

You understand that Rabby (and all other networks with which the Offering may be compatible) remains under development, which creates technological and security risks when using the Offerings in addition to uncertainty relating to Digital Assets and transactions therein. You acknowledge that the cost of transacting on Rabby is variable and may increase at any time, thereby impacting any activities taking place on Rabby, which may result in price fluctuations or increased prices for using the Offerings.

You acknowledge that the Offerings are subject to flaws and that you are solely responsible for evaluating any code provided by the Site or the Offerings. This warning and others which the Company provides in these Terms in no way evidence or represent any on-going duty to alert you of the potential risks of utilizing the Offerings or accessing the Site.

Although we intend to provide accurate and timely information on the Site and during your use of the Site and the Offerings, that intention does not reflect a binding commitment, and the Site and other information available when using the Offerings may not be accurate, complete, error- free or current. To continue to provide you with as complete and accurate information as possible, information may be changed or updated from time to time without notice, including, without limitation, information regarding our policies. Accordingly, you should verify all information before relying on it in any manner, and all decisions based on such information contained on the Site or made available through the Offerings are your sole and absolute responsibility. No representation of any kind or nature is made as to the accuracy, completeness or appropriateness for any particular purpose of any pricing or other information distributed via the Site or the Offerings. Pricing information may be higher or lower than prices available on platforms providing similar services.

Any reference to a type of Digital Asset on the Site or otherwise during the use of the Offerings does not indicate our approval or disapproval of the technology on which the Digital Asset relies, and should not be used as a substitute for your understanding of the risks specific to each type of Digital Asset and the use and availability of any particular blockchain.

Use of the Offerings, in particular for trading Digital Assets, may carry financial risk. Digital Assets are, by their nature, highly experimental, risky, and volatile. Transactions entered into in connection with the Offerings are irreversible, final and there are no refunds. You acknowledge and agree that you will access and use the Site and the Offerings at your own risk. The risk of loss in trading Digital Assets can be substantial (all the more so if you are leveraged). You should, therefore, carefully assess whether such trading is suitable and appropriate for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources. By using the Site and the Offerings, you represent and warrant that you have been, are, and will be solely responsible for making your independent appraisal and investigations into the risks of a given transaction and the underlying Digital Assets. You represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice, and experience to make your evaluation of the merits and risks of any transaction conducted in connection with the Offerings or any Digital Asset. You accept all consequences of using the Offerings, including the risk that you may lose access to your Digital Assets indefinitely. All transaction decisions are made solely by you. Notwithstanding anything in these Terms, we accept no responsibility whatsoever for, and will in no circumstances be liable to you in connection with, your use of the Offerings for performing Digital Asset transactions.

The Company is a developer of software. The Company is not a broker, nor is it a dealer or arranger, nor does it operate a Digital Asset exchange platform or offer trade execution or clearing services and, therefore, has no oversight, involvement, or control concerning the transactions you choose to conduct via the Offerings. All transactions between users of the Company-developed software are executed peer-to-peer directly between the users' Rabby (or other network) addresses through smart contracts. You are responsible for complying with all laws that may be applicable to or govern your use of the Offerings, including, but not limited to, the Commodity Exchange Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”), the federal securities laws and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and all foreign laws that apply to you and your trading.

You understand that the Company is not registered or licensed by the CFTC, SEC, or any other financial regulatory authority (whether in the United States\*\* \*\*or elsewhere). No financial regulatory authority has reviewed or approved the use of the Company -developed software that comprises the Site and the Offerings. The Site and the Company-developed software do not constitute advice or a recommendation concerning any commodity, security, or other Digital Asset or instrument. The Company is not acting as an investment manager, adviser, arranger, introducer or commodity trading adviser to any person or entity.

You expressly agree that you assume all risks in connection with your access and use of the Site and the Offerings and your interaction therewith. You further expressly waive and release the Company**Parties** from any and all liability, claims, causes of action, or damages arising from or in any way relating to your use of the Site and the Offerings and your interaction therewith. If you are a California resident, you waive the benefits and protections of California Civil Code § 1542, which provides: “[a] general release does not extend to claims that the creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her, would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or released party.”

## **Indemnity; Limitation of Liability.**

1. Indemnification. You will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company and its affiliates, and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives (the “**Company Parties**”), from and against any claims, disputes, demands, liabilities, damages, Losses, and costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees (collectively, the “**Losses**”), arising out of, relating to or in any way connected with (i) your access to or use of the Site, Offerings or Content, (ii) your User Content, (iii) Third Party Services, (iv) your violation of these Terms, (v) your violation of the rights of a third party, including but not limited to intellectual property rights and/or privacy rights, or (iv) any overt harmful act towards any other user of the Offerings with whom you connected via our Site or Services.
1. Limitation of Liability

   1. THE COMPANY PARTIES SHALL NOT BE LIABLE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THOSE RESULTING FROM LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION), WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY AUTHORIZED OR UNAUTHORIZED USE OF THE SITE, THE OFFERINGS, EVEN IF AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COMPANY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF OR KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THE COMPANY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES FOR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO SOFTWARE, PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND/OR INFORMATION OFFERED OR PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES AND ACCESSED THROUGH THE SITE OR THE OFFERINGS. THE FOREGOING DISCLAIMER WILL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW.
   1. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR PERSONAL INJURY, OR OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COMPANY PARTIES' TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES (OTHER THAN AS MAY BE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW IN CASES INVOLVING PERSONAL INJURY) EXCEED THE LOWER OF (I) THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY YOU HEREUNDER FOR THE OFFERINGS GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY IN THE TWELVE MONTHS PRECEDING THE FIRST INCIDENT OUT OF WHICH THE LIABILITY AROSE, OR, (II) THE AMOUNT OF ONE HUNDRED U.S. DOLLARS ($USD101.00) OR ITS EQUIVALENT IN THE LOCAL CURRENCY OF THE APPLICABLE JURISDICTION.

## **Mandatory Arbitration.**

PLEASE READ THIS “MANDATORY ARBITRATION” PROVISION VERY CAREFULLY. IT LIMITS YOUR RIGHTS IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND THE COMPANY, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS SET FORTH BELOW.

1. You and the Company agree that any and all past, present and future disputes, claims, or causes of action arising out of or relating to your use of any of the Site or the Offerings, this Agreement, or any other controversies or disputes between you and the Company (including, without limitation, disputes regarding the effectiveness, scope, validity or enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate) (collectively, “**Dispute(s)**”), shall be determined by arbitration, unless (A) your Country of Residence does not allow this arbitration agreement; (B) you opt out as provided below; or (C) your Dispute is subject to an exception to this agreement to arbitrate set forth below. You and the Company further agree that any arbitration pursuant to this Section shall not proceed as a class, group or representative action. The award of the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

   For the purposes of this Agreement, “**Country of Residence**” to arbitrate means the country in which you hold citizenship or legal permanent residence, as well as any country from which you regularly access and use the Company Offerings. If more than one country meets that definition for you, then your country of citizenship or legal permanent residence shall be your Country of Residence, and if you have more than one country of citizenship or legal permanent residence, it shall be the country with which you most closely are associated by permanent or most frequent residence.

1. Notice of Dispute. The Company wants to address your concerns without the need for a formal legal dispute. Before filing a claim against the Company, you agree to try to resolve the Dispute informally by contacting the Company at **<support@rabby.io>** to notify the Company of the actual or potential Dispute. Similarly, the Company will undertake reasonable efforts to contact you to notify you of any actual or potential dispute to resolve any claim we may possess informally before taking any formal action. The party that provides the notice of the actual or potential Dispute (the “**Notifying Party**”) will include in that notice (a “**Notice of Dispute**”) the name of the User, the Notifying Party's contact information for any communications relating to such Dispute (including for the Notifying Party's legal counsel if it is represented by counsel in connection with such Dispute), and sufficient details regarding such Dispute to enable the other party (the “**Notified Party**”) to understand the basis of and evaluate the concerns raised. If the Notified Party responds within ten (10) business days after receiving the Notice of Dispute that it is ready and willing to engage in good faith discussions in an effort to resolve the Dispute informally, then each party shall promptly participate in such discussions in good faith.

   If, notwithstanding the Notifying Party's compliance with all of its obligations under the preceding paragraph, a Dispute is not resolved within thirty (30) days after the Notice of Dispute is sent (or if the Notified Party fails to respond to the Notice of Dispute within ten (10) business days), the Notifying Party may initiate an arbitration proceeding as described below. If either party purports to initiate arbitration without first providing a Notice of Dispute and otherwise complying with all of its obligations under the preceding paragraph, then, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the arbitrator(s) will promptly dismiss the claim with prejudice and will award the other party all of its costs and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with such Dispute.

1. Agreement to Arbitrate. We both agree to arbitrate (unless you opt out as described below). You and the Company each agree to resolve any Disputes that are not resolved informally as described above through final and binding arbitration as discussed herein, except as set forth under “Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate” below.
1. Exceptions to Agreement to Arbitrate. The parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
1. You and the Company agree that:

   1. If you are located in the United States: This Agreement and any Dispute (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of this Agreement as a court would. The arbitration will be conducted in accordance with the expedited procedures set forth in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the “**Rules**”) as those Rules exist on the effective date of this Agreement, including Rules 1.1 and 1.2 of those Rules. The arbitrator’s decision shall be final, binding, and non-appealable. Judgment upon the award may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction. Neither party shall sue the other party other than as provided herein or for enforcement of this clause or of the arbitrator’s award; any such suit may be brought only in a Federal District Court or a Texas state court located in Tarrant County, Texas. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement including any claim that all or any part of the Agreement is void or voidable. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we and you waive any right to a jury trial. Notwithstanding the foregoing we and you both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to enjoin infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights;
   1. If you are located in any territory that is other than the United States, this Agreement and any Dispute (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with it or its subject matter or formation shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Singapore. Any Claim relating in any way to this Agreement, the Offerings, your use of the Offerings, or to any products or services licensed or distributed by us will be resolved by binding arbitration as provided in this clause. Prior to commencing any formal arbitration proceedings, parties shall first seek settlement of any claim by mediation in accordance with the Singapore International Mediation Centre Rules. The language to be used in the mediation and in the arbitration shall be English. The seat or legal place of arbitration shall be Singapore.

1. You and the Company further agree that, if you so elect, all proceedings can be conducted via videoconference, telephonically or via other remote electronic means.
1. You and the Company agree that the arbitration of any Dispute shall proceed on an individual basis, and neither you nor the Company may bring a claim as a part of a class, group, collective, coordinated, consolidated or mass arbitration (each, a “**Collective Arbitration**”). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a claim to resolve any Dispute against the Company will be deemed a Collective Arbitration if (a) two (2) or more similar claims for arbitration are filed concurrently by or on behalf of one or more claimants; and (b) counsel for the claimants are the same, share fees or coordinate across the arbitrations. For the purpose of this provision, “**Concurrently**” means that both arbitrations are pending (filed but not yet resolved) at the same time.
1. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER YOU NOR THE COMPANY SHALL BE ENTITLED TO CONSOLIDATE, JOIN OR COORDINATE DISPUTES BY OR AGAINST OTHER INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES, OR ARBITRATE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, INCLUDING AS A REPRESENTATIVE MEMBER OF A CLASS OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY. IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISPUTE, ANY AND ALL SUCH RIGHTS ARE HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVED. THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS WAIVER IS A MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS OF SERVICES, AND THAT IT IS ENTERED INTO AFTER CAREFUL CONSIDERATION AND WITH FULL KNOWLEDGE OF ITS LEGAL CONSEQUENCES. THIS WAIVER SHALL BE BINDING ON THE PARTIES AND THEIR SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS, AND MAY ONLY BE MODIFIED OR WAIVED IN WRITING SIGNED BY BOTH PARTIES. Without limiting the foregoing, any challenge to the validity of this paragraph shall be determined exclusively by the arbitrator.
1. Notwithstanding your and the Company's agreement to arbitrate Disputes, either you or the Company shall retain the following rights: (i) the right to bring an individual action in small claims process in the courts of your Country of Residence; and (ii) the right to seek provisional relief in aid of arbitration in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. Further, this agreement to arbitrate does not deprive you of the protection of the mandatory provisions of the consumer protection laws in your Country of Residence; you shall retain any such rights and this agreement to arbitrate shall be construed accordingly.
1. Except as otherwise required by applicable law or provided in this Agreement, in the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your Dispute, you and the Company agree that any judicial proceeding may only be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in Singapore. Both you and the Company consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there; provided that either party may seek provisional relief in aid of arbitration to enforce its intellectual property rights as provided above or bring an action to confirm an arbitral award in any court having jurisdiction.
1. This agreement to arbitrate shall survive the termination of this Agreement. With the exception of the provisions of this agreement to arbitrate that prohibit Collective Arbitration, if a court decides that any part of this agreement to arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, then the remaining portions of this agreement to arbitrate shall nevertheless remain valid and in force. In the event that a court finds the prohibition of Collective Arbitration to be invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this agreement to arbitrate shall be deemed void (but no provisions of this Agreement unrelated to arbitration shall be void), and any remaining Dispute must be litigated in court pursuant to Section 1.1.

## **Confidentiality**

From time to time during the term of this Agreement, either you and the Company (as the “**Discloser**”) may disclose or make available to the other party (as the “**Recipient**”) information about its business affairs, services, confidential intellectual property, trade secrets, third-party confidential information and other sensitive or proprietary information, whether or not marked, designated, or otherwise identified as “confidential” (collectively, “**Confidential Information**”).

Confidential Information shall not include information that, at the time of disclosure: (i) is or has become generally available to the public other than as a result of any breach of this Section 12 by the Recipient or any of its affiliates, employees, officers, directors, partners, shareholders, agents, attorneys, accountants, or advisors (collectively, the “**Representatives**”); (ii) is obtained by the Recipient or its Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a third-party that was not legally or contractually restricted from disclosing such information; (iii) was in the Recipient’s or its Representatives’ possession prior to disclosure by the Discloser hereunder; (iv) was or is independently developed by the Recipient or its Representatives without using of any of the Discloser’s Confidential Information; or (v) is required to be disclosed under applicable federal, state, or local law, regulation, or a valid order issued by a court or governmental agency of competent jurisdiction.

The Recipient shall: (i) protect and safeguard the confidentiality of the Discloser’s Confidential Information with at least the same degree of care as the Recipient would protect its own Confidential Information, but in no event with less than a commercially reasonable degree of care; (ii) not use the Discloser’s Confidential Information, or permit it to be accessed or used, for any purpose other than to perform its obligations under this Agreement; and (iii) not disclose any such Confidential Information to any person or entity, except to the Recipient’s Representatives who need to know the Confidential Information to assist the Recipient, or act on its behalf, to exercise its rights or perform its obligations under the Agreement. The Recipient shall be responsible for any breach of this Section 12 caused by any of its Representatives.

## **Miscellaneous.**
